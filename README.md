# sjupyter

A simple wrapper script that integrates Jupyter and SLURM.  Similar conceptually to JupyterHub's [batchspawner](https://github.com/jupyterhub/batchspawner), but with less overhead than a full-fledged JupyterHub setup.  Suitable as an intermediate step between a JupyterHub/SLURM integration and just plain old vanilla SLURM.

Based on a script by Julien Seiler of [IGBMC](http://www.igbmc.fr).
